# Midterm Project - Squeezit FIP
This repo contains the submission for the MMED-1055 Midterm Project by Jin Cheon. The project focuses on developing two boxed responsive HTML pages from the Squeezit FIP site using a mobile-first approach and the grid system built in class.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to create a responsive, grid-based layout that adapts across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes using CSS media queries. The layouts follow the original design plan as closely as possible while allowing room for refinement in the final FIP submission. Placeholder content is used where necessary, and key structural elements such as navigation, headings, and images are included. All files are organized and uploaded to GitHub following the best practices covered in class.
